## **Overview**  
This repository archives the agent-based model and outputs for the research project:  

**Of Kinship and Wealth: An Agent-Based Model of Rural and Urban Migration**  
*Claremont Graduate University – SPE 316, Agent-Based and Computational Modeling*  

Rapid urbanization is one of the most significant demographic shifts of the last half-century, with the UN projecting that 68% of the global population will live in urban areas by 2050. This study uses an **agent-based model** to explore how employment, kinship ties, and wages drive migration patterns.  

### **Key Insights**  
- **Employment opportunities** are the primary driver of internal migration in the model.  
- Kinship and wage factors alone do not trigger migration without available employment opportunities.  
- Results highlight the importance of employment availability for migration, particularly in developing regions.
